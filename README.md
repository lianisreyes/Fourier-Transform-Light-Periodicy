# Fourier-Transform-Light-Periodicy
Project for Dr. Shane Davis - ASTR 5470 Computational Astrophysics at UVA 
The purporse of this notebook is to read in spectra data and produce periodicy based 
useing FFTs. You may input an .npz file or produce artificial data from the module. The main code will then take the information and use FFT in order to produce a graph with the periodicity. The code will also save pngs for graphs and save .npz file for the artificial data. To test this code we used artificially created data with 4 levels noise in order to test efficiency. After testing it we didn't note any issue with the functin of the code with the increase of noise.
