# Fourier-Transform-Light-Periodicy
Project for Dr. Shane Davis - ASTR 5470 Computational Astrophysics at UVA 
The purporse of this notebook is to read in spectra data and produce periodicy based 
useing FFTs 
To test this code we used artificially created data with 4 levels noise in order to test eficciency. 
Code was produced with the help of Reynier Squillace and
